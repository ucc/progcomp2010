<<PLEASE SEE THE CONTENTS OF doc/ FIRST>>

Hi there,

Thanks for taking interest in the UCC Programming Competition 2010. If you 
don't already know what it's all about, check out the information provided in 
the docs directory, which contains a full and authoritative* description for
the running of the competition.

This file is by no means complete, and not ready for circulation.

The first thing you'll probably want to do is see it work. Try running:

./simulate -v

to see the sample agents duke it out for up to 150 rounds (the current sample
agents suck - rounds either go for seconds or for ages). After that, take a
look at sampleAgents.py to see how agents are implemented on top of the
BaseAgent and LearningAgent classes. When you're ready to try out your own,
edit the first few lines of simulate.py to include your agent.

...and if all you're interested in is participating, that's it! You can stop
reading, and start work on the agent that will outsmart them all!


* Or rather, it wil by the time this package is ready for distribution.
