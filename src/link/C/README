== Compiling and testing the sample bots ==

Run "make" in this directory. To include them in the 

== Making your own agent ==
See wiki page.

Also, use the link/bundle-agent.sh shell script - it will take your agent file
and make a python module that you can include.

= Testing your own agent =
Edit src/simulate.py.
Your agents live in link.C.c_agents
Add them to Agents to get them to do battle.

For example, this code imports c_angel, c_lucifer, c_streetfighter and
c_frenchie, as well as the python sample agents, and then battles c_lucifer, 
python Frenchie, c_streetfighter and c_angel. It goes at the top of simulate.py.

# Import and add your agents here:
from link.C.c_agents import c_angel, c_lucifer, c_streetfighter, c_frenchie

from SampleAgents import Angel, Lucifer, Dummy, Frenchie, Streetfighter
Agents = [c_lucifer, Frenchie, c_streetfighter, c_angel]
