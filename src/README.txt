Hi there,

You've reached the source directory of the UCC::ProgComp 2010.

For documentation, see the contents of the "doc" directory.

The first thing you'll probably want to do is see it work. Try running:

./simulate -v

to see the sample agents duke it out.

This is a brief overview of the included files and directories:
 - USINGPYTHON.txt: A guide to writing an agent in Python.
 - SampleAgents.py : the sample agents.
 - agents/ : where you put your agent.
 - arenas/ : arenas define which agents play against which, and some other parameters.
 - link/ : Other languages belong here.
 - conf.py : has various useful things like the ability to turn on debug support.

The rest of the files are probably not useful to you, but just for completeness:
 - simulate.py : run a simulation.
 - uccProgComp.py : the guts of the competition.
 - rpsconst.py : various constants, such as the points table.

Ignore anything else. :P
