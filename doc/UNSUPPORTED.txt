UNSUPPORTED.txt: This file describes the wire protocol. You should only need this if you're debugging a non-Python agent, or if you're interested in writing an agent in an unsupported language.

If you are interested in using an unsupported language, consult the website for details on how to check with the organiser first.

=== Wire protocol ===

The syntax for input and output is as follows. Every line of input given by the supervisor must be replied with the correct response.
Segmentation fault is never the correct response :-). Rumour has it that if you just use Python, this won't happen. 

The angle brackets (<>) indicate whether the line is output from the agent or input to it respectively, and are not part of the actual formatting.

Syntax for when your agent is spawned:
>HI uuid

Syntax for an attacking agent:
>ATTACK foeName
<ATTACKING itemToUse itemToPromise
Example:
>ATTACK agent00002
<ATTACKING Paper Scissors

Syntax for a defending agent:
>DEFEND foeName foePromisedItem
<DEFENDING itemUsed
Example:
>DEFEND agent00001 Scissors
<DEFENDING Rock

Syntax for collecting results:
>RESULTS foeName isInstigatedByYou winner yourItem theirItem promisedItem pointChange
<OK
Example:
>RESULTS agent00001 False Attacker Rock Paper Scissors -2
<OK

Syntax for cleaning up after your bot - either the round has ended, or you've been killed off
>BYE
