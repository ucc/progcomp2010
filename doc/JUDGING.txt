JUDGING.txt: An insight into the capricious and arbitrary mind of the 
organiser on how your agent will be judged.

IN SUMMARY: write clean, efficient, portable, smart code that just does 
what it's told and doesn't try to do anything it shouldn't. Don't rely 
on *anything* not expressed in sample code, or preferably, 
documentation. If in doubt, ask.

THINGS NOT TO DO:
 - Inline assembler.
 - Deliberately obfuscated code.
 - Attempts to communicate between agents (other than by known sequences 
of bluffs/attacks).
 - File, network or system access.

Other points:

There are lots of divisions. Each division has its own prizes. How many 
divisions there are, and what the prizes are, depends on how much we get 
sponsored, and how creative I am at the time.

Be honest in the divisions you sign up for, and don't play silly games. 
Trying to break the software, security, machines, my mind, etc., are all 
frowned upon and may result in instant disqualification, etc., as laid 
out in the rules.

To win the most prizes:
 - Allow your agent to be run on the scoreboard: I might give a prize to 
top-of-the-ladder agents.
 - Make your agent as fast and efficient as possible - there might be 
*lots* of instances.
